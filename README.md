# hrms-client

Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript web app for the HRMS. Talks to `../hrms-server` over
GraphQL with [urql](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/urql/).

## Run locally

Start the API first (see `../hrms-server/README.md`), then:

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open http://acme.localhost:3000 (the subdomain picks the tenant). Next.js forwards
`/graphql` and `/api/*` to Django, so the browser only ever talks to one origin.

## GraphQL types

Types and typed documents in `src/gql/` are generated from the server's `schema.graphql`.
After the API changes:

```sh
npm run schema    # copies ../hrms-server/schema.graphql and runs codegen
```

Write queries with `graphql(\`...\`)` from `@/gql`; never hand-write API types.

## Checks

```sh
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

## Notes

- Permission checks in the UI (`useSession().can(...)`) only shape what is shown. The API
  enforces every rule.
- `src/proxy.ts` sends visitors without a session cookie to `/login`.
